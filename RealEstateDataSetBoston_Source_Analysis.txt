<My Analysis of This Result _ I am sure this will wrong analysis......>
*(I think "lower status of the population" is inappropriate. But I use this because the dataset uses these words.)
*(The dataset is old but it seemed good enough for testing.)
Distance to the workplace is about survival to the low-income population.
And the towns of Boston seem to understand the circumstance and allow them to live close to their workplace.
But, regardless of the distance to their workplace, the towns with a high percentage of lower status of the population suffer bad crime rates.
I should say it is not the town that suffers crimes, but all people who live in the town suffer.
Maybe the quality of the affordable housing matters.
